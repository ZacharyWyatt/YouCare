# YouCare
An Android app that serves as a checklist for keeping track of care for one's pets or dependents, a well as a repository of their personal information. All images were created by me.

You+Care allows one to save up to four profiles for pets or individuals. These profiles hold basic information such as height, weight, and age, as well as a profile picture. Profiles have their own customizable checklists, which enables users to keep track of tasks i.e. "Has Spot eaten today?" (Y/N).
