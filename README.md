# YouCare
 An assignment I completed in college, spring 2018. The goal was to create an Android application of our choice, with a focus on showcasing the elements of UI control that we'd learned so far. This app is meant to be used as a checklist for keeping track of care of one's pets or dependents. All images were created by me.
