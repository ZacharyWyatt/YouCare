# YouCare
An assignment I completed in college, spring 2018. The goal was to create an Android application of our choice, with a focus on showcasing the elements of UI control that we'd learned so far. This app is meant to be used as a checklist for keeping track of care of one's pets or dependents. All images were created by me.

You+Care allows one to save up to four profiles for pets or individuals. These profiles hold basic information such as height, weight, and age, as well as a profile picture. Profiles have their own customizable checklists, which enables users to keep track of tasks i.e. "Has Spot eaten today?" (Y/N).
